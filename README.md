# Fingerprint-based-ATM-System
Built a secure web-based banking system using HTML and CSS for the frontend and Python for the backend. The system eliminates ATM card usage by enabling fingerprint authentication. Only the registered nominee can access the account, with OTP verification required to complete transactions securely.
